Standalone Web API
==================

The standalone web Api is to enable integration with 3rd party mobile companies. The API will allow authorised users to create new codes, access certain customer information and change pay amount.

## Architecture

The Standalone Web API is a part-rest client which will use OAuth to verify users, built on Silex PHP Framework. Registered users will need to request an API key, which will be used to login and use the system.
